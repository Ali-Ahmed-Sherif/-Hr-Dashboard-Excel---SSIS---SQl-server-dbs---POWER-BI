# -Hr-Dashboard-Excel---SSIS---SQl-server-dbs---POWER-BI
The Applicants Dashboard was built to help the company management and recruitment team analyze applicant data from the 2026 season.
##  Project Overview

The challenge began when the recruitment form responses were collected through a Google Sheet, which was messy, inconsistent, and lacked data standardization.  
As a data engineer and analyst, I designed a complete ETL (Extract‚ÄìTransform‚ÄìLoad) workflow and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to answer key questions about applicants‚Äô demographics, interests, and engagement.

##  Workflow Summary

### 1Ô∏è Data Extraction
- Exported raw dataset from Google Sheets as an Excel file.  
- The data contained non-standardized text fields, inconsistent formats (like ‚ÄúAAST‚Äù vs ‚ÄúArab Academy‚Äù), and missing values.

### 2Ô∏è Data Transformation (Power Query)
- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query in Power BI.  
- Standardized values across all categorical columns:
  - Unified university names, faculties, and departments.  
  - Converted text-based graduation years to integers.  
  - Extracted and formatted date and time from timestamps.  
  - Handled missing and duplicate entries.  
  - Renamed columns for clarity and consistency.

### 3Ô∏è Data Loading (SSIS + SQL Server)
- Automated the loading pipeline using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).  
- Configured an SSIS data flow to load the cleaned Excel file into SQL Server.  
- Created the target table schema in SQL Server:

  ```sql
